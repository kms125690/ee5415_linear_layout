# ee5415_week_3_linear_layout

LinearLayout is a ViewGroup that displays child View elements in a linear direction, either
vertically or horizontally. You should be careful about over-using the LinearLayout. If you
begin nesting multiple Linear Layouts, you may want to consider using a ConstraintLayout
instead (see next section).
1. Start a new project named Linear Layout.
2. Follow the hello-world-style to fill in these values:
• Choose your project : Empty Activity
• Application name : Linear Layout
• Package name : com.example.linearlayout
• Language : Java
• Minimum API level: API 21: Android 5.0 (Lollipop)
• Click Finish
• Default created Activity:
• Activity Name: MainActivity
• Layout Name: activity_main
3. Modify the layout XML in res/layout/activity_main.xml
